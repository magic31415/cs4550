    <h1>User-First Design</h1>
		<h3>As a new user, I should be able to register for a new account.</h3>
		<p>
		  To register for a new account, a user first reaches the home page. 
		  Then he clicks the "Sign Up" button, which brings him to another page where he
		  enters his email address, username, and password (twice). Then he submits the form and receives an
		  email confirmation. Clicking the confirmation link in the email activates the account.
		</p>
		<h3>As a normal user, I can post a message.</h3>
		<p>
		  To post a message, the user locates the message textbox on the top of the main page. 
		  Then, she types her message and clicks the "Post My Message" button. Then, the message shows
		  up below the textbox so she can see how it turned out.
		</p>
		<h3>As a normal user, I can follow someone.</h3>
		<p>
		  To follow someone else, a user searches for another user by username by typing the username in a
		  search box on the top of the main page. After hitting the "Search" button, the requested account page is
		  displayed. The user can then press the "Follow" button to follow this person. Now, if he goes back to the main
		  page, he will start seeing this new person's messages in his feed.
		</p>
		<h3>As a normal user, I can read messages of those that I follow</h3>
		<p>
		  To read messages, simply scroll down through the main page. You will be able to see messages
		  of people you have followed in the reverse order that they were written.
		</p>
		<h3>As a normal user, I can see other messages that use the same hashtag</h3>
		<p>
		  To see other messages with a certain hashtag, a user first finds a message with a hashtag. Then, she can
	    click the hashtag in the message, which will appear as a link. This will then bring her to a new page which
		  will display all the messages that contain that hashtag. From there, she can read them.
